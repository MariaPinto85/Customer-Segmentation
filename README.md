# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation Project
This repository contains the Customer Segmentation Project, which analyzes global customer data to identify patterns, clusters, and demographic distributions. This project uses advanced data visualization and clustering techniques to uncover insights about customers worldwide.

 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore customer data to:

Visualize global customer density and clustering.
Understand demographic patterns, including gender distribution and departmental representation.
Provide actionable insights for business and marketing strategies.

The project incorporates:

Global data visualization: Highlighting customer density worldwide.
Interactive dashboards: Allowing for exploration of gender, department, and regional distributions.
Clustering analysis: Identifying key customer clusters to better target strategies.
